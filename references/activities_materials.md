## Material Presentation Principles

1. **Invitation**: "Would you like a lesson on..."
2. **Preparation**: Ensure child is ready, material is complete
3. **Demonstration**: Slow, precise movements; minimal language
4. **Child practice**: With adult present initially
5. **Independence**: Child works independently
6. **Mastery**: Child can teach another

## Error Control Built Into Materials
- Self-correcting design (puzzle pieces fit one way)
- Visual control (patterns complete correctly)
- Tactile control (texture differences)
- Quantity control (specific number of pieces)
